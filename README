Chemistry/Smiles version 0.11
=============================

This object-oriented module parses a SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line
Entry Specification) string. It can either return the molecule as a Chemistry::Mol
object or be used via callback functions.

For more information about SMILES, see The SMILES Home Page at
http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/smiles/

This module is under development and doesn't implement the full SMILES syntax
yet.

Missing features:
* Branches that start before an atom (such as (OC)C, which should be 
  equivalent to C(CO) and COC).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module is designed to work with Chemistry::Mol (coming soon), but it does
not require it.
